<h2>All student pages</h2>
<p>All student pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "student_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Assignments page</h2>
<p>The Assignments Page shows you assignments that you can submit to.</p>

<h3>'Show..' menu</h3>
<p>On the left hand of the page, under the navigation menu, is a menu that allows you to control which assignments are shown on this page. The items in the menu are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Open assignments', which will display assignments that are open and which you are a registered student for.</li>
	<li>'Closed assignments', which will display assignments that have closed and which you are a registered student for.. You may only submit a solution to these assignments if you have been granted a deadline extension.</li>
	<li>'Open and closed assignments', which will display all assignments that you are a registered student for.</li>
	<li>'Assignments by module...', which will take you to the Modules page to select a module to display assignments from. This is primarily used if you are not registered for a module that you wish to submit a solution for.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignments table</h3>
<p>The main part of the page contains a table of assignments that you may submit to, providing that they haven't passed the close date. This table provides the following details:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Assignment' column, which will display the name of the assignment and the name of the parent module below it. Clicking on the assignment name will take you to the Assignment Details page for that assignment. Similarly, clicking on the module name will take you to the Module Details page for that module.</li>
	<li>'Due date' column, which will display the date by which you should submit your solutions. If the date is in red, you have not submitted an assignment and a submission is overdue. This column will also show any deadline extensions that you may have been granted.</li>
	<li>'Last submitted' column, which will display the date that you last submitted a solution to the assignment.</li>
	<li>'Actions' column, which will display a 'Submit solution...' button if you may submit a solution, or 'closed' if you may not. Clicking the button will allow you to submit a solution to the assignment. If you have submitted any previous solutions, there will be a 'Previous submissions...' link that you can click on to manage those submissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The table may be sorted by clicking on the headers. Clicking on the same header twice will reverse the order. The following headers can be clicked:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Due date', to sort by the date that a submission is due by.</li>
	<li>'Last submitted', to sort by the date that you last submitted a solution on.</li>
</ul>
