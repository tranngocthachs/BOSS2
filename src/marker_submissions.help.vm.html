<h2>All marker pages</h2>
<p>All marker pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "marker_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Submissions page</h2>
<p>The submissions page allows you to access the submissions that a student has made for a particular assignment.</p>

<h3>Submissions table</h3>
<p>The main part of the page displays a table of submissions that the student has provided for the selected assignment. This table provides the following details:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Submission for' column, which displays the name of the assignment and the name of the parent module below it. Clicking on the assignment name will take you to the Assignment Details page for that assignment. Similarly, clicking on the module name will take you to the Module Details page for that module.</li>
	<li>'Active' column, which displays whether the submission is the active submission. An active submission is a submission that will be marked in preference to all other submissions. If the submission is active, 'Student requests this submission be marked ' is displayed. If not, the column will be empty.</li>
	<li>'Date' column, which displays when the submission was submitted to the BOSS2 system.</li>
	<li>'Actions' column, which displays buttons for each of the actions described in the next section.</li>
</ul>

<p>The table may be sorted by clicking on the headers. Clicking on the same header twice will reverse the order that the items are sorted by. You may click the following headers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Active', which will place the active submission at the top of the list and all others below it.</li>
	<li>'Date', which will sort by the submission date.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>The 'Actions' column of the main table provides the following actions for each submission:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Download', which will initiate a download of the submission as it was received by BOSS2.</li>
	<li>'Test', which will allow you to perform tests on the submission to verify its correctness.</li>
</ul>
