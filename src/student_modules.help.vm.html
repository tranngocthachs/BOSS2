<h2>All student pages</h2>
<p>All student pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "student_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Modules page</h2>
<p>The Modules page provides a list of modules that you are registered for or that do not require registration to access. It is used to select a module to browse the assignments for via the 'Assignments by module...' menu entry on the Assignments page.</p>

<h3>Modules table</h3>
<p>The main part of the page contains a table listing the modules for which you have access to. You have access to a module if you are a student for that module or if the administrator has marked the module as open for anyone. The table contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Module' column, which displays the module name and a link to browse the assignments under that module. If you click the module name you will be taken to the Module Details page for that module.</li>
	<li>'Model' column, which displays the model that the module comes under. The model is used to group modules for a certain purpose, such as an academic year.</li>
</ul>
