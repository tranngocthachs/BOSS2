<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Test hash page</h2>
<p>The test hash page allows you to simulate submitting a solution to an assignment to generate a verification code.  This is useful if, for example, BOSS2 loses a submission and a student has a submission verification code to prove they made the submission.</p>

<h3>Hashing a solution</h3>
<p>There is a list of files that you are required to upload, followed by a button marked 'Hash'.</p>
<p>To perform the hash, you most browse your computer for each file requested before clicking the 'Hash' button.. If you do not wish to make a hash, you can navigate away from the page using the breadcrumbs, menu, or browser back button.</p>
