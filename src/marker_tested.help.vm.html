<h2>All marker pages</h2>
<p>All marker pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "marker_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Test Submission page</h2>
<p>The Test Solution page allows you to select tests to run on a solution.</p>

<h3>Testing a submission</h3>
<p>The main area of the page displays the following details about the submission that is to be tested:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Module that the submission was submitted to.</li>
	<li>The Assignment that the submission was submitted to.</li>
	<li>The time that the submission was performed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this there are check boxes to allow you to select which tests you wish to run on the submission. If there are no tests, the checkboxes will be replaced with a message saying 'There are no tests for this assignment'.  Next to each test will be a note saying whether the test is open for students and markers, or markers only.</p>
<p>To test the submission, check the boxes to select the tests that you wish to run and click 'Test Submission'. If you do not wish to test the submission, you can navigate away from the page using the breadcrumbs, menu, or browser back button.</p>
