<h2>All marker pages</h2>
<p>All marker pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "marker_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Students page</h2>
<p>The students page displays a list of students that you can mark (or moderate, if you are a moderator) for an assignment, and provides access to their submissions and marks.</p>

<h3>Students table</h3>
<p>The main part of the page contains a table displaying information on the students that you may mark. The table provides the following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Person' column, which will display the name and email address of the student to be marked, or '(Blind marking)' if that student is to be marked anonymously. If the email address is displayed, clicking on it will allow you to email the student.</li>
	<li>'Submissions' column, which will display the number of submissions that the student has made for the assignment.</li>
	<li>'Last marked by you' column, which will display the date that you last created a mark for this student (if you have created one).</li>
	<li>'Action' column, which contains an 'Access submissions' button and a 'Mark/moderate Student' button, which explained in the next sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table may be sorted by clicking on the column headers. Clicking twice on the same header will reverse the sorting order. You can click on the following headers to sort the table:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Person', which will sort the table by the student's identifier.</li>
	<li>'Submissions', which will sort the table by the number of submissions that the student has made.</li>
	<li>'Last marked by you', which will sort the table by the time that you last marked the student.</li>
</ul>
