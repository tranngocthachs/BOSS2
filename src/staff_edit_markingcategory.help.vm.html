<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit Marking Category page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to edit, delete or create a marking category.   Marking categories are particular aspects of a solution that should be marked.  Each has a weighting in the final mark, and for a result to be complete there should be a mark provided for each marking category.</p>

<h3>Creating/editing the marking category</h3>
<p>A marking category has the following values that must be filled in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Name': the name of the marking category.</li>
	<li>'Weighting': the weighting the marking category has in the final, published result.</li>
	<li>'Maximum mark': the maximum mark available for this marking category.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deleting the marking category</h3>
<p>If you are not creating a marking category, under the values for the module there will be a checkbox marked 'Delete this marking category'. To delete the marking category rather than edit it, select this checkbox. If you are creating a marking category this checkbox will not be visible.</p>

<h3>Confirming</h3>
<p>If you are editing or deleting a marking category there will be a button labeled 'Perform Edit/Delete'. If you are creating a marking category the button will be labeled 'Perform Create'. Once you are sure of the values you have selected, click this button to commit the details to the BOSS2 database. If you do not wish to create, edit or delete a marking category navigate away from the page using the navigation menu, breadcrumbs or browser back button.</p>
