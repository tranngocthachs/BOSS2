<h2>Logout page</h2>
<p>The logout page is displayed once you have logged out of the BOSS2 system. It provides links to different parts of the site.</p>

<h3>Section Links</h3>
<p>In the right hand column there are four links ('student', 'marker', 'staff' and 'admin') that will navigate you to the various sections of the site. These sections are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Student section, for submitting solutions to assignments.</li>
	<li>Marker section, for marking submitted solutions.</li>
	<li>Staff section, for managing assignments.</li>
	<li>Admin section, for managing people, modules and the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking them will take you to those sections directly, after prompting you for login credentials.</p>

<h3>Help</h3>
<p>On the bottom right of the page there are three links:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Help, to take you to the online help.</li>
	<li>About BOSS, to take you to the credits for the BOSS2 system.</li>
	<li>Accessibility, to take you to a page describing the accessibility features of the BOSS2 system.</li>
</ul>
