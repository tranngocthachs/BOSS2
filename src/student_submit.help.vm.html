<h2>All student pages</h2>
<p>All student pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "student_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Submit page</h2>
<p>The submit page allows you to submit a solution to an assignment.  A solution is a set of required files for the markers to mark.</p>

<h3>Submitting a solution</h3>
<p>The main area of the page displays the following details about the submission that is to be made:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Module that the submission is for. This can be clicked to take you to the Module Details page for that module.</li>
	<li>The Assignment that the submission is for. This can be clicked to take you to the Assignment Details page for that Assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this are a list of files that you are required to upload, followed by a button marked 'Submit'.</p>
<p>To perform your submission, you most browse your computer for each file requested before clicking the 'Submit' button.. If you do not wish to make a submission, you can navigate away from the page using the breadcrumbs, menu, or browser back button.</p>
<p><em>Note: there is no penalty for making multiple submissions. You may also specify later on which submission you prefer to be marked by navigating to the previous submissions page for that assignment.</em></p>
