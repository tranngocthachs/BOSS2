<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Staff assignments page</h2>
The staff page shows you all of the assignments for a given module.  An assignment is a subject that a student may submit solutions to.

<h3>Creating a new assignment</h3>
<p>The actions menu on the left of the page has an item labelled 'Create new assignment...' which can be clicked to create a new assignment under the current module.</p>

<h3>Switching mode</h3>
<p>The assignments page has far too much information to display all at once, and is split into two modes.  These modes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Submission', which will allow you to create/delete/edit assignments and their submissions, tests, and deadline revisions.</li>
	<li>'Marking', which will allow you to create/delete/edit assignments and their marking categories, markers, marking assignments and results.</li>
</ul>
<p>The actions menu on the left of the page, below 'Create new assignment', has an entry to allow you to switch mode.  If you are in Submission mode this will say 'Switch to marking view...' and clicking it will switch you to marking mode.  Conversely, if you are Marking mode this will say 'Switch to submission view...' and clicking it will switch you to submission mode.</p>

<h2>Submission mode</h2>
<h3>Assignments table</h3>
<p>The main part of page contains a table describing the assignments in the current module.  The table contains the following information for each assignment, one assignment to a row:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Assignment' column, which displays the name of the assignment.</li>
	<li>'Submissions' column, which displays the number of submissions made to the assignment.  Next to this is a '(Manage...)' link which may be clicked to manage the submissions.</li>
	<li>'Tests' column, which displays the number of tests the assignment has.  Next to this is a '(Manage...)' link which may be clicked to manage the tests.</li>
	<li>'Deadline Revisions' column, which displays the number of deadline revisions the assignment has.  Next to this is a '(Manage...)' link which may be clicked to manage the deadline revisions.</li>
	<li>'Actions' column, which displays three buttons: 'Edit/Delete', 'Upload Resource', and 'Verify submission code'.  These are explained in the next section.</li>
</ul>

You can click the headers of the columns to sort the tables.  Clicking the same header twice will reverse the direction.  The following headers may be used for sorting:
<ul>
	<li>'Submissions', which will sort by the number of submissions under the assignment.</li>
	<li>'Tests', which will sort by the number of tests under the assignment.</li>
	<li>'Deadline Revisions', which will sort by the number of deadline revisions under the assignment.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
