<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Staff submissions page</h2>
The submissions page shows you all of the submissions for a given assignment.  These submissions were made by students.

<h3>Submissions table</h3>
<p>The main part of page contains a table describing the submissions in the current assignment.  The table contains the following information for each submission, one submission to a row:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Name' column, which displays the unique identifier (aka. username) of the student that made the submission, with their chosen name underneath.</li>
	<li>'Submission Time' column, which displays the time the submission was received by the BOSS2 system.</li>
	<li>'To be marked' column, which displays whether the student wants the submission to be marked.</li>
	<li>'Actions' column, which displays a 'Download' button.  Click this to download the submission as it was received by the BOSS2 system.</li>
</ul>

You can click the headers of the columns to sort the tables.  Clicking the same header twice will reverse the direction.  The following headers may be used for sorting:
<ul>
	<li>'Name', which will sort by the student's unique identifier (aka username).</li>
	<li>'Submission time', which will sort by the time the submission was received by the BOSS2 system.</li>
</ul>
