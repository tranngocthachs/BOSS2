<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit Deadline Revision page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to edit, delete or create a deadline revision.   Deadline revisions are a new deadline for a student, overriding the closing date of the assignment.</p>

<h3>Creating/editing the test</h3>
<p>A test has the following values that must be filled in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'New deadline': the new date that the student must submit their solution by.</li>
	<li>'Student': the student that the deadline revision is for.</li>
	<li>'Reason': a comment explaining why the deadline revision was granted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deleting the deadline revision</h3>
<p>If you are not creating a deadline revision, under the values for the module there will be a checkbox marked 'Delete this deadline revision'. To delete the deadline revision rather than edit it, select this checkbox. If you are creating a deadline revision this checkbox will not be visible.</p>

<h3>Confirming</h3>
<p>If you are editing or deleting a deadline revision there will be a button labeled 'Perform Edit/Delete'. If you are creating a deadline revision the button will be labeled 'Perform Create'. Once you are sure of the values you have selected, click this button to commit the details to the BOSS2 database. If you do not wish to create, edit or delete a deadline revision navigate away from the page using the navigation menu, breadcrumbs or browser back button.</p>
