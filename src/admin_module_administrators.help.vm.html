<h2>Admin module administrators page</h2>
The module administrators page shows you all of the administrators for a given module.  An administrator for a module is allowed access to the staff section to administrate the module.

<h3>Add a new administrator</h3>
To add an administrator, click the 'Add administrator' item in the 'Actions' menu on the left hand side of the page.

<h3>Administrators table</h3>
The main part of page contains a table describing the administrators in the current module.  The table contains the following information for each administrator, one administrator to a row:
<ul>
	<li>'Person' column, which displays the identifier for the person and below it the person's chosen name.</li>
	<li>'Email' column, which displays the e-mail address of the administrator.  You may click the address to compose an email to the administrator.</li>
	<li>'Actions' column, which displays a button marked 'Remove administrator'.  Click this button to remove the administrator from the module.</li>
</ul>

You can click the headers of the columns to sort the tables.  Clicking the same header twice will reverse the direction.  The following headers may be used for sorting:
<ul>
	<li>'Person', which will sort by the administrator's unique identifier.</li>
	<li>'E-mail Address', which will sort by the administrator's email address.</li>

</ul>
