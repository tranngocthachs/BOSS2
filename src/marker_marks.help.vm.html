<h2>All marker pages</h2>
<p>All marker pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "marker_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Marks page</h2>
<p>The marks page displays marks created for a student on a particular assignment. If you are a normal marker, only your marks will be displayed. If you are a moderator, marks from all markers will be displayed (though you will only be able to edit your own marks).</p>

<h3>Creating a new mark</h3>
<p>Under the navigation menu is an 'Actions' menu. Clicking 'Create new mark...' in this menu will create a new mark and take you to the Edit Mark page for that mark.</p>

<h3>Marks table</h3>
<p>The main part of the page contains a table displaying information on the marks that you are available for the given student on the given module. The table provides the following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Marker' column, which will display the identifier and name of the marker that created the mark. Clicking the name will allow you to email the marker.</li>
	<li>'Marking category' column, which will display the name of the marking category that the mark is under.</li>
	<li>'Timestamp' column, which will display the time that the mark was last edited (or created if never edited).</li>
	<li>'Mark' column, which displays the value of the mark and the maximum value described by the marking category that the mark is under.</li>
	<li>'Comment' column, which displays a short comment written by the marker about the mark.</li>
	<li>'Action' column, which displays an 'Edit/Delete' button if you created the mark, or nothing if not. If you created the mark, click the 'Edit/Delete' button to edit or delete the mark.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table may be sorted by clicking on the column headers. Clicking twice on the same header will reverse the sorting order. You can click on the following headers to sort the table:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Marker', which will sort the table by the marker's identifier.</li>
	<li>'Marking Category', which will group similar marking categories together (though in no particular order at the moment).</li>
	<li>'Timestamp', which will sort the table by the time the marks were last edited (or created if never edited).</li>
	<li>'Mark', which will sort the table by the left hand value of the mark - i.e., the result, not the maximum mark obtainable.</li>
</ul>
