<h2>All admin pages</h2>
<p>All admin pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "admin_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Admin models page</h2>
The models page shows you all of the models current in the BOSS2 database.  A model is a collection of modules, for example a course or a year.

<h3>Creating a new model</h3>
To create a new model, click the 'Create new model' item in the 'Actions' menu on the left hand side of the page.

<h3>Models table</h3>
The main part of page contains a table describing the models in the database.  The table contains the following information for each model, one model to a row:
<ul>
	<li>'Model' column, which displays the name of the model and below it a link marked 'Manage models...'  You can click the name of the model to edit it or the 'Manage modules...' link to manage the modules under the model.</li>
	<li>'Modules' column, which displays the number of modules under the model.</li>
	<li>'Actions' column, which displays a button marked 'Edit/Delete Model', which you can click to edit or delete the model.</li>
</ul>

You can click the headers of the columns to sort the tables.  Clicking the same header twice will reverse the direction.  The following headers may be used for sorting:
<ul>
	<li>'Modules', which will sort by the number of modules a model has.</li>
</ul>
