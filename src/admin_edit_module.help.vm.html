<h2>All admin pages</h2>
<p>All admin pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "admin_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit Module page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to edit, delete or create a module.</p>

<h3>Creating/editing the module</h3>
<p>A module has the following values that must be filled in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Unique identifier': a small textual identifier for the module.  No two modules may have the same unique identifier.</li>
	<li>'Name': a custom name for the module.  Names do not need to be unique and may be longer.</li>
	<li>'Requires registration': a flag stating whether students need to register to the module to be allowed access to it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deleting the module</h3>
<p>If you are not creating a module, under the values for the module there will be a checkbox marked 'Delete this module'. To delete the module rather than edit it, select this checkbox. If you are creating a module this checkbox will not be visible.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: If the module has assignments you will not be able to delete the module until those assignments are deleted.</em></p>

<h3>Confirming</h3>
<p>If you are editing or deleting a module there will be a button labeled 'Perform Edit/Delete'. If you are creating a module the button will be labeled 'Perform Create'. Once you are sure of the values you have selected, click this button to commit the details to the BOSS2 database. If you do not wish to create, edit or delete a module navigate away from the page using the navigation menu, breadcrumbs or browser back button.</p>
