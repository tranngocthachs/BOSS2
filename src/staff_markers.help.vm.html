<ul>
	<li>'Person' column, which displays the identifier for the person and below it the person's chosen name.</li>
	<li>'Email' column, which displays the e-mail address of the marker.  You may click the address to compose an email to the marker.</li>

</ul>

You can click the headers of the columns to sort the tables.  Clicking the same header twice will reverse the direction.  The following headers may be used for sorting:

</ul>
