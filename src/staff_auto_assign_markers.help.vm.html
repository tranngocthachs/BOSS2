<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Auto-assign markers page</h2>
<p>The auto-assign markers page allows you to automatically generate marking assignments to bind markers to students.</p>

<h3>Auto-assigning markers</h3>
<p>To auto-assign markers, select the method by which you want to assign markers, and click the 'Perform Selected' button.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: The 'All markers to a student' method can create a very large amount of mappings (for example, 30 students and 4 markers would generate 120 mappings).</em></p>
