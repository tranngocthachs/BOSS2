<h2>All admin pages</h2>
<p>All admin pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "admin_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit Model page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to edit, delete or create a model.</p>

<h3>Creating/editing the model</h3>
<p>A model has the following values that must be filled in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Unique identifier': a small textual identifier for the model.  No two models may have the same unique identifier.</li>
	<li>'Name': a custom name for the model.  Names do not need to be unique and may be longer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deleting the model</h3>
<p>If you are not creating a model, under the values for the model there will be a checkbox marked 'Delete this model'. To delete the model rather than edit it, select this checkbox. If you are creating a model this checkbox will not be visible.</p>

<h3>Confirming</h3>
<p>If you are editing or deleting a model there will be a button labeled 'Perform Edit/Delete'. If you are creating a model the button will be labeled 'Perform Create'. Once you are sure of the values you have selected, click this button to commit the details to the BOSS2 database. If you do not wish to create, edit or delete a model navigate away from the page using the navigation menu, breadcrumbs or browser back button.</p>
<p><em>Note: if the model has modules, you will not be able to delete it until you remove the sub-modules.</em></p>
