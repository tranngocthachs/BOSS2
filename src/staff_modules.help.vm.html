<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Staff modules page</h2>
The staff page shows you all of the modules that you are able to administrate.  A module is a collection of assignments, for example a subject on a course.

<h3>Modules table</h3>
The main part of page contains a table describing the modules that you are allowed to administrate.  The table contains the following information for each module, one module to a row:
<ul>
	<li>'Module' column, which displays the unique identifier of the module and below it its name.</li>
	<li>'Assignments' column, which displays the number of assignments under the module, as well as two links to manage them.  These links are explained in the next section.</li>
	<li>'Students' column, which displays the number of students for the module as well as a '(Manage...)' link.  To manage the students for this module, click the '(Manage...)' link.</li>
</ul>

You can click the headers of the columns to sort the tables.  Clicking the same header twice will reverse the direction.  The following headers may be used for sorting:
<ul>
	<li>'Assignments', which will sort by the number of assignments under the module.</li>
	<li>'Students', which will sort by the number of students under the module.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing assignments</h3>
Under the number of assignments are two links that you can click to manage assignments.  These are:
<ul>
	<li>'(Manage submission...)', which will allow you to create/delete/edit assignments and their submissions, tests, and deadline revisions.</li>
	<li>'(Manage marking...)', which will allow you to create/delete/edit assignments and their marking categories, markers, marking assignments and results.</li>
</ul>
