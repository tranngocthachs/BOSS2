<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit Marking Assignment page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to edit, delete or create a marking assignment.   Marking assignments bind a student to a marker.</p>

<h3>Creating/editing the marking assignment</h3>
<p>A marking assignment has the following values that must be filled in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Student': the student to be marked.</li>
	<li>'Marker': the marker marking the student.</li>
	<li>'Blind marking': a flag that when checked renders the marker unable to access any details about the student they are marking.</li>
	<li>'Moderating': a flag that when checked enables the marker to see marks created by other markers for the student they are marking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deleting the marking assignment</h3>
<p>If you are not creating a marking assignment, under the values for the module there will be a checkbox marked 'Delete this marking assignment'. To delete the marking assignment rather than edit it, select this checkbox. If you are creating a marking assignment this checkbox will not be visible.</p>

<h3>Confirming</h3>
<p>If you are editing or deleting a marking assignment there will be a button labeled 'Perform Edit/Delete'. If you are creating a marking assignment the button will be labeled 'Perform Create'. Once you are sure of the values you have selected, click this button to commit the details to the BOSS2 database. If you do not wish to create, edit or delete a marking assignment navigate away from the page using the navigation menu, breadcrumbs or browser back button.</p>
