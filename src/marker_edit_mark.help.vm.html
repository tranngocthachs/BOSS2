<h2>All marker pages</h2>
<p>All marker pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "marker_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit Mark page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to edit, delete or create a mark for a student on a given assignment.</p>

<h3>Creating/editing the mark</h3>
<p>The main area of the page displays the following details about the mark that is to be created or edited:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Assignment that the mark is for.</li>
	<li>The Student that the mark is for. This can be clicked to email the student.</li>
</ul>
<p>A mark has the following values that must be filled in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Marking category': the marking category that the mark is under. A mark can only have one marking category - to mark multiple categories you must create multiple marks for each category. Click the marking category that you wish the mark to be for.</li>
	<li>'Mark value': the value of the mark. This must be a whole number, but may be any number (including negative or over the maximum mark). It's highly recommended to keep the number between 0 and the maximum mark for the given marking category.</li>
	<li>'Marker's comment': a comment about the mark. This will only be seen by you and the moderator(s) and is used for internal review purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deleting the mark</h3>
<p>If you are not creating a mark, under the values for the mark there will be a checkbox marked 'Delete this mark'. To delete the mark rather than edit it, select this checkbox. If you are creating a mark this checkbox will not be visible.</p>

<h3>Confirming</h3>
<p>If you are editing or deleting a mark there will be a button labeled 'Perform Edit/Delete'. If you are creating a mark the button will be labeled 'Perform Create'. Once you are sure of the values you have selected, click this button to commit the details to the BOSS2 database. If you do not wish to create, edit or delete a mark navigate away from the page using the navigation menu, breadcrumbs or browser back button.</p>
