<h2>All student pages</h2>
<p>All student pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "student_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Test Results page</h2>

<ul>
	<li>'Result' column, which displays the numerical mark that the test produced.</li>
	<li>'Output' column, which displays the output from running the test.</li>
