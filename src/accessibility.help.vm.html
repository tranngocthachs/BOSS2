<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>BOSS2 attempts to be as accessible as possible to all users.</p>

<h2>Web technologies</h2>
<p>In order to be most accessible for users, BOSS2 followed the following guidelines during development:</p>
<ul>
	<li>BOSS2 tries to adhere to XHTML strict with standard CSS2.</li>
	<li>BOSS2 tries to adhere to WAI to at least the first level.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any page fails to validate against these standards, please contact the maintainers.</p>

<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>BOSS2 uses Javascript for the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Displaying a calendar picker for date/time input in the staff section.</li>
	<li>Pop-up windows and forms.  This is achieved by rewriting anchor and form tags to use the non-standard 'target' tag if possible.  If not possible, links will display in situ.</li>
	<li>Providing a 'Close Window' link in pages that were designed to be popped up.</li>
</ul>
