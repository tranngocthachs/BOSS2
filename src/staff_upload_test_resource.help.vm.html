<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Upload test resource page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to upload an test resource.  Test resources are available to the command executors for running tests and could contain libraries, programs to run, and/or reference data.</p>
<p>When the test is run, the test resource is unpacked into a directory which is passed to the command executor.  For this reason the test resource must be a valid .zip or .jar archive (.jar archives are actually just .zip archives).</p>

<h3>Uploading a test resource</h3>
<p>To upload an test resource select the resource in the file choose under 'Resource file'.</p>

<h3>Confirming</h3>
<p>To confirm the upload, click the 'Perform Upload' button.  This will overwrite any existing test resource that was uploaded.  If you do not wish to upload a test resource, navigate away from the page using the menu, breadcrumbs or browser back button.</p>
