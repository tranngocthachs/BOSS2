<h2>All staff pages</h2>
<p>All staff pages have the same basic layout, which is described <a href="$context.getPageUrl("help", "staff_generic")" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit Assignment page</h2>
<p>This page allows you to edit, delete or create an assignment.</p>

<h3>Creating/editing the assignment</h3>
<p>An assignment has the following values that must be filled in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>'Name': a custom name for the assignment.  Names do not need to be unique.</li>
	<li>'Deadline': the date and time at which students are notified they are overdue for submission.</li>
	<li>'Opening date': the date and time at which students are granted access to the assignment.</li>
	<li>'Closing date': the date and time at which students are denied access to the assignment, unless they have deadline revisions granting them extra time.</li>
	<li>'Allow delete': a flag stating whether students are allowed to delete previous submissions.  Not recommended as it destroys a potential 'paper' trail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deleting the assignment</h3>
<p>If you are not creating an assignment, under the values for the module there will be a checkbox marked 'Delete this assignment'. To delete the assignment rather than edit it, select this checkbox. If you are creating an assignment this checkbox will not be visible.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: If the assignment has anything that depends on it (e.g. submissions, tests, marking categories, results) you will not be able to delete it.</em></p>

<h3>Confirming</h3>
<p>If you are editing or deleting an assignment there will be a button labeled 'Perform Edit/Delete'. If you are creating an assignment the button will be labeled 'Perform Create'. Once you are sure of the values you have selected, click this button to commit the details to the BOSS2 database. If you do not wish to create, edit or delete an assignment navigate away from the page using the navigation menu, breadcrumbs or browser back button.</p>
