<h3>Students table</h3>
The main part of page contains a table describing the student in the current module.  The table contains the following information for each student, one student to a row:
<ul>
	<li>'Person' column, which displays the identifier for the person and below it the person's chosen name.</li>
	<li>'Email' column, which displays the e-mail address of the student.  You may click the address to compose an email to the student.</li>
	<li>'Actions' column, which displays a button marked 'Remove student'.  Click this button to remove the student from the module.</li>
</ul>

You can click the headers of the columns to sort the tables.  Clicking the same header twice will reverse the direction.  The following headers may be used for sorting:
<ul>
	<li>'Person', which will sort by the student's unique identifier.</li>
	<li>'E-mail Address', which will sort by the student's email address.</li>
</ul>
