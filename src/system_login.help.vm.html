<h2>Login page</h2>
<p>The login page is displayed automatically when your credentials are required to access a page. It allows you to provide your credentials and continue to the destination page.</p>

<h3>Logging in</h3>
<p>To log in to BOSS2, type your username and password into the left hand column and click 'Log in...'. Upon a successful login you will be taken automatically to the section that you were navigating to. If you navigated to the login page manually, you will be taken to a generic 'logged in' page.</p>

<h3>Forgotten credentials</h3>
<p>If you have forgotten your password, click the 'Forgotten your password?' link next to the password box.</p>

<h3>Login troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you are confused, are not sure what your credentials are, or have problems with logging in, click the 'Login/Registration help' link under the right hand column.</p>

<h3>Help</h3>
<p>On the bottom right of the page there are three links:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Help, to take you to the online help.</li>
	<li>About BOSS, to take you to the credits for the BOSS2 system.</li>
	<li>Accessibility, to take you to a page describing the accessibility features of the BOSS2 system.</li>
</ul>
