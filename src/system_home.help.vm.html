<h2>Home page</h2>
<p>This is the page that you will be greeted with, or will be returned to if you click upon the logo in the top left at any type.</p>

<h3>Section Links</h3>
<p>Under the logo, and next to 'take me to' there are four links ('student', 'marker', 'staff' and 'admin') that will navigate you to the various sections of the site. These sections are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Student section, for submitting solutions to assignments.</li>
	<li>Marker section, for marking submitted solutions.</li>
	<li>Staff section, for managing assignments.</li>
	<li>Admin section, for managing people, modules and the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking them will take you to those sections directly, prompting you for login credentials if you are not already logged in. If you are already logged in you will not be asked for your login credentials again until you log out.</p>

<h3>Help</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Help, to take you to the online help.</li>
	<li>About BOSS, to take you to the credits for the BOSS2 system.</li>
